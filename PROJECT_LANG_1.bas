' About:
' I decided to make FreeBasic the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-FreeBasic) as FreeBasic is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the FreeBasic programming language. It only makes sense to FreeBasic the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
